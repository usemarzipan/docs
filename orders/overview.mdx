### Exporting Orders

You can export orders to a CSV file by clicking the **Export** button in the top-right corner of the orders table. This will download a CSV file containing all the orders in the table.

When you click the **Export** button, you will be shown a modal where you can select the fields you want to export. The app will remember your selection for the next time you export orders.
