Fulfilling orders is the process of preparing and sending orders to customers. Marzipan provides a simple and easy way to orders as shipped.

### Manual Fulfilment

It is easy to fulfil orders manually in Marzipan. To fulfil an order, click the **Fulfil** button in the fulfilment section of the order details page.

When you click the **Fulfil** button, you will be shown a modal where you can select the fulfilment method and add any notes to the order. The fulfilment method is the method you will use to ship the order to the customer.

### Automatic Fulfilment

If you are using the London City Bond integration and have set up a flow to automatically send orders to London City Bond then Marzipan will automatically create a shipment for the order with a status of `Processing`. Orders sent to London City Bond are checked daily and will update the order status to `Shipped` or `Delivered` as and when they are processed.
