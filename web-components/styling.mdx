### Introduction
You can customise the appearance of the web components to match your branding by adding CSS to your website.

<Tip>
Styling the web components is optional, but recommended to match your branding, and requires an understanding of CSS. If in doubt, please ask your web developer to take a look.
</Tip>

We use TailwindCSS to style the web components, which are isolated from your global CSS so that they do not affect the rest of your website.

We use the [**part**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part) attribute to style the web components, which allows you to target specific elements within each component. The format is always `web-component::part(element-name)`.

### Examples

This CSS would target the button within the add to cart component, using Tailwind classes that exist with your own CSS styles.

```css
marzipan-addtocart::part(--add-to-cart-button) {
    @apply text-white py-3 px-4 uppercase no-underline text-sm hover:bg-zinc-900;
}
```

And this CSS would target the cart icon of the cart icon component using traditional CSS.

```css
marzipan-carticon::part(cart-icon) {
    color: #bebebe;
}
```

Because of how the web components are structured and how `part` works, we may use the same name for the same part in different components. For example, the `--marzipan-spinner` part is used in multiple components. However you must target each part separately:

```css
marzipan-cart::part(--marzipan-spinner), marzipan-checkout::part(--marzipan-spinner) {
    color: #399383
}
```

### Available parts

Available parts are listed under each component's **Styling** section.
