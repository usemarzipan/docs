### Features

#### Subscription Products
The product component automatically detects and handles subscription products, including pick-and-mix subscriptions. For subscription products, it integrates with the subscription configuration component to provide frequency selection and item management.

#### Upsell Products
When a product has upsell variants, the component displays a dropdown selection allowing customers to choose between different options before adding to cart.

#### Pricing Display
The component intelligently displays pricing based on:
- Sale prices vs regular prices
- Subscriber pricing for logged-in subscribers
- Bundle pricing with custom text
- Price badges for sales and subscriber discounts

#### Image Gallery (Full View)
The full view includes an image gallery with:
- Main image display with loading states
- Thumbnail navigation
- Support for product images and label images
- Fallback placeholder when no images are available

#### SEO Features (Full View)
The full view automatically injects:
- Meta tags for social sharing
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for search engines
- Dynamic page titles
- Product availability and pricing information

The product component uses the [add to cart](./add-to-cart) component to handle cart functionality. If you have set styles for the add to cart component, they will be applied to the buttons within this component.
