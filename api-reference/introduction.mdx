# Marzipan API

The Marzipan API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Getting Started

1. **Register an account** using the `/account/register` endpoint
2. **Login** to obtain authentication credentials
3. **Explore** the available endpoints organized by category

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to: `https://api.marzipan.co/v1`
