The Marzipan REST API enables you to interact with the Marzipan platform, retrieve data, and allow customers to manage their and accounts.

<Note>
The API is currently in beta and subject to change.
</Note>

## Getting Started

To get started with the Marzipan API, you will need to create an API key with the right permissions in your Marzipan [account settings](https://app.marzipan.co/settings/api).

You will be able to choose the permissions you need for your API key. The current available permissions are:

- `read` - read access to products, collections, events, subscriptions and CMS
- `create` - create access to products, collections, events, subscriptions and CMS
- `update` - update access to products, collections, events, subscriptions and CMS
- `delete` - delete access to products, collections, events, subscriptions and CMS
- `cart:create` - create access to carts
- `cart:update` - update access to carts
- `cart:read` - read access to carts
- `cart:delete` - delete access to carts


## Authentication

The Marizpan API uses Bearer authentication. Include your generated api key in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests.

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Keep your API key secure and never expose it in a public repository or share it with untrusted parties. If you believe your API key has been compromised, you can revoke it and generate a new one in your [account settings](https://app.marzipan.co/settings/api).
