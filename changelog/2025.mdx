## Tasks

<Frame>

</Frame>
Introduced a task management system for tracking work across customers, orders, and subscriptions. Tasks can be created directly from customer, order, and subscription pages, automatically linking them to the relevant entity for full context. Features priority levels (low, medium, high, urgent) with visual indicators, configurable due dates with friendly date displays (Today, Tomorrow, specific dates), and user assignment capabilities. The dedicated tasks page includes filtering by status (complete/incomplete), priority levels, and due date ranges (today, tomorrow, next 7 days, no date), flexible sorting options (due date, priority, creation date), and pagination for large task lists. Tasks integrate seamlessly with the activity log system, recording creation, updates, and completions with full audit trails including old/new value tracking for changes. Dashboard integration displays today's incomplete tasks with overdue items prioritised, sorted by priority and due date for quick access to urgent work. The system includes comprehensive authorisation policies ensuring users can only manage their assigned tasks, automated activity logging when tasks are updated or completed. Task creation is available throughout the application via notes/activity interfaces on customer, order, and subscription detail pages, with an enhanced activity component supporting both traditional notes and task creation from a single interface.

## Mailchimp Integration

Completely rebuilt the Mailchimp integration with OAuth 2.0 authentication support, eliminating the need for manual API key management (now depreceated).

Implemented intelligent batch syncing with rate limit handling for efficient bulk customer synchronization. Added detailed sync logging and status tracking with comprehensive error reporting.

## Events

#### Waitlist System

Implemented a waitlist management system for sold-out events. Customers can join waitlists with their desired quantity through a new dedicated waitlist dialog component. Features automatic promotion notifications when tickets become available via email with secure time-limited claim links. Includes position tracking showing customers their place in line, configurable expiration handling for unclaimed promotions, and seamless integration with the deposit payment system. Automatic inventory release and re-promotion of next customers when spots expire.

Added split payment support, allowing customers to secure tickets with a deposit and pay the balance later. Features configurable deposit amounts per event, customizable balance due dates, automatic payment request notifications at configured intervals, comprehensive ticket status tracking throughout the payment lifecycle (deposit paid, balance pending, balance paid), and clear messaging in checkout showing deposit vs. full payment amounts. Integrated throughout the web components with clear UI indicators for deposit requirements.

#### Recurring Occurrences

Introduced support for recurring events with multiple occurrences, perfect for ongoing workshops, tastings, and regular events. Supports daily, weekly, and monthly recurrence patterns with configurable end dates. Each occurrence maintains its own ticket inventory, attendee management, and waitlist. Customers can select their preferred date from a dropdown of available occurrences. Individual occurrence tracking for capacity, tickets sold, and revenue.

#### Management

Enhanced event capabilities with a comprehensive suite of management tools. Features include a full attendee management interface with detailed attendee lists and tracking, ticket cancellation workflow with automated partial or full refunds, event categorization and types (wine tasting, workshop, dinner, tour), check-in functionality for day-of event management, configurable ticket limits per order, location coordinates for mapping integration, and rich email notifications throughout the event lifecycle (ticket confirmation, cancellation, balance payments, reminders).
