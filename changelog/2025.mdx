## Low Stock Badges

Added low stock badges to provide clear inventory visibility and encourage purchases. Badges can be configured globally across all products or customised on a per-product basis. Web components will honour the low stock settings and display a badge if the stock level is below the threshold and can be styled to match your brand. Stock level settings are also available through the API to support custom implementations.

## Media Management

Added a new media management section where you can view all media uploaded to your account. We've added support for alt tags, made it easy to copy links to media. We've improved the media functionality in the editor to make it easier to add existing and new media to your content and to resize it. We've also laid the groundwork for future media management features including video support and image editing.
